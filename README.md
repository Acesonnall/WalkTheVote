# Walk The Vote
*Election Saver â€¢ Pog The Vote*

**Hand-deliver your ballot today!**

Walk the Vote is an effort to ensure people can hand-deliver their ballots to their local county/city/parish election offices. Most, if not all, states allow you to physically deliver your mail-in/absentee ballot to these establishments. The important part is, they allow you to do so early. Beat the stress of waiting in line on Election Day during a pandemic and worrying about your ballot getting lost or not counted by the USPS!

Most states are now open for early drop-off ballot voting! We can help you find those, with our easy-to-use datbabase lookup. Enter your 5-digit US Zip, and we will return the address & contact info of the nearest county elections office and clerk. 

*NOTE: Some jurisdictions also allow you to drop off your ballots at individual polling place drop-off boxes. Our app doesn't quite list those locations, but perhaps thi will be a future feature!*
